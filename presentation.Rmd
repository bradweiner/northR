# What is Shiny?

- Rstudio package authored by Joe Cheng

--

- Web development framework for R

--

- Can be used to build interactive web pages with R

--

- No knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript required

--

- Can share R analysis with any audience type.

---


# Let's get started: Install shiny!


```{r eval=F, echo=T}
# install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
# install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
#runExample("01_hello")
```

# Shiny App Basics: Part 1

- Every Shiny App is made up of two parts

- UI: a web page that shows the app to the user. UI is HTML using Shiny’s functions and is where the layout of hte app is defined (how the app looks). 

- Server: a computer that powers the app that has the logic of the functionality. 

---

# Shiny App Basics: Part 2

## Shiny Template 

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 1

--

### Create a standalone app.R 
--

- All your code is in one place

--

- your file must be named app.R for Rstudio to recognize it as a shiny app.

-- 

- Your turn: Run app01.R


???

Run app01.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 2

--

### Create a ui.R and server.R 
--

- This is great for more complex applications

--

- our examples today will primarily be app.R files to make the concepts easy to follow.

--

- Your turn: Open folder App_02 and run either the ui or server file.

???

Run app02.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 3

--

### In Rstudio >> File >> Shiny Web App
--

- this will automatically set up the template for you.

--

- you can customize it like app

---
#Exercise 02

## Let's a real app: Run app.R in App03

???
Pause 1 minute
---

## Your turn: Add a title to this app reference code in app_01.R

???

Pause 1 minute

---
# Shiny App Contents

--
- UI: Layout and app appearance

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
ui <- fluidePage() 
```
--
- Server: instructions to build the app
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
server <- function(input, output){} 

shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server)
```

---

## Now let's build a real app using college grad student data (fivethirtyeight package) 


---
# App Basics

- Step 1:load the data from five thirty eight
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
library(fivethirtyeight)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

# Remember the ui portion of the app 

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
library(fivethirtyeight)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


---
# App Basics: UI 

## Inputs and Outputs

- fluidPage - sets up basic visual structure of a page.

- selectInput(others like it): allow users to interact and provide a value

- verbatimTextOutput() and tableOutput() are output controls that tell Shiny where to put the output.


---

# UI 

- UI simply creates HTML (Shiny allows you to create UI without having to know HTML)

--

- HTML tags can be found at http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html

--

- Simple ones: h1() = header1, br() = line break, strong() = bold text

--

- You can access HTML tag using `tags` object

--

- h2 = tags$h2(), br = tags$br()

--

- Don't have to use `tags` for common objects


---

#UI with HTML example: Run ui_html_05.R
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
	h1("Shiny App Title"),
	h4("This is awesome"),
	"Hello",
"Shiny workshop",
br(),
strong("bold text")
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

- Pause 1 minute
---

# UI 

---
# UI with Layouts

- Typically all items stack up after the other.

--

- Layouts: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html

--

- advanced layouts: fluidRow and column to build your layout up from a grid system or navbarpage

--

- We’ll use sidebarLayout() as done in the example

---
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),

  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
???

- fluidpage creates a page that dynamically adapts to the size of your window

- look at basics_ui_right_04.R for examples


---

# You can also use tags within *Panel command: UI with Layout and HTML

### Open and run tags_html_06.R

---

# UI: Widgets

- shiny also has built in widgets 

.pull-center[
![](img/shiny_widgets.png)]

---

# UI: Widgets

- you can add widgets in your sidebarPanel or mainPanel of the app

- All widgets have the first two arguments in common:

    1. name for the widget so you can access the widget and trigger actions or effects.
    2. label: the name of the widget in your app. 
    
- learn more about widgets: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/

# Let's go back to the app we were trying to build with college grad data


.pull-center[
![](img/college_grad_ui.png)]


---

# Session

- A session is the state of one live instance of a running shiny app

- begins when app is loaded in a browser 

- each session needs to be independent to avoid overlapping actions

- the server function is called once for each session (private scope) so every variable inside the server function is only available to that function.
---

# Server 

- Three components:input, output, session

- session begins when shiny app runs

- input:  list-like object that has all the input data from the user interaction with the browser

```{r eval=F, echo=T}

ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)

```
---
# Server
- input objects are read only from the browser(ultimate source of info). So this will return an error:

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  input$length <- 85 
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
# Error: Attempted to assign value to a read-only reactivevalues object


```
- can only be read in a reactive context like renderPlot() or reactive()

---

# Server : Render function

- Outputs are reactive: Shiny recalculates them as the user interacts and changes them.

- there is a **render** function designed for each type of output: renderPrint, renderTable, renderPlot, etc. 

.pull-center[
![](img/shiny_render.png)]

---

# Server: Render Function (cont'd)

- render functions do two things:

  1.  reactive contexts that tracks inputs for outputs uses 

  2.  converts R code to HTML to display


---
# Server
- output: list-like object named after the output ID. This is to send info back to the browser

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textOutput("message")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$message <- renderText({
    "Hello shiny course!"
  })
}
```
---
# Introducing Reactivity

- Shiny uses reactivity to make apps interactive (Stay tuned.)

--

- In reactivity, you are telling someone how to do something without telling them to actually do it (just instructions)

-- 

- Example: 


```{r eval=F, echo=T}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$summary <- renderPrint({
    dataset <- get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)
    summary(dataset)
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    dataset <- get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)
    dataset
  })
}
```

???

The left-hand side of the assignment operator (<-), output$IDENTIFIER, indicates that you’re providing the recipe for the Shiny output with the matching ID. The right-hand side of the assignment specifies uses a specific render function to wrap a code block that you provide; in the example above, we use renderPrint and renderTable wrap our app-specific logic.
