## Throughout this talk we will switch back and forth between demos and slides.

---

# What is Shiny?

- Rstudio package authored by Joe Cheng

--

- Web development framework for R

--

- Can be used to build interactive web pages with R

--

- No knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript required

--

- Can share R analysis with any audience type.

---


# Let's get started: Install shiny!


```{r eval=F, echo=T}
# install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
# install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
#runExample("01_hello")
```

# Shiny App Basics: Part 1

- Every Shiny App is made up of two parts

- UI: a web page that shows the app to the user. UI is HTML using Shiny’s functions and is where the layout of hte app is defined (how the app looks). 

- Server: a computer that powers the app that has the logic of the functionality. 

---

# Shiny App Basics: Part 2

## Shiny Template 

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 1

--

### Create a standalone app.R 
--

- All your code is in one place

--

- your file must be named app.R for Rstudio to recognize it as a shiny app.

-- 

- Your turn: Run app01.R


???

Run app01.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 2

--

### Create a ui.R and server.R 
--

- This is great for more complex applications

--

- our examples today will primarily be app.R files to make the concepts easy to follow.

--

- Your turn: Open folder App_02 and run either the ui or server file.

???

Run app02.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 3

--

### In Rstudio >> File >> Shiny Web App
--

- this will automatically set up the template for you.

--

- you can customize it like app

---
#Exercise 02

## Let's a real app: Run app.R in App03

???
Pause 1 minute
---

## Your turn: Add a title to this app reference code in app_01.R

???

Pause 1 minute

---
# Shiny App Contents

--
- UI: Layout and app appearance

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
ui <- fluidePage() 
```
--
- Server: instructions to build the app
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
server <- function(input, output){} 

shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server)
```

---

## Now let's build a real app using college grad student data (fivethirtyeight package) 

---
# App setup: Step 1

- load the data from five thirty eight
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
library(fivethirtyeight)
ui <- fluidPage()
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---

# UI with HTML

- UI simply creates HTML
--
- HTML tags can be found at http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html
--
- Simple ones: h1() = header1, br() = line break, strong() = bold text
--
- You can access HTML tag using `tags` object
--
- h2 = tags$h2(), br = tags$br()
--
- Don't have to use `tags` for common objects


---

#UI with HTML example: Run ui_html_05.R
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
	h1("Shiny App Title"),
	h4("This is awesome"),
	"Hello",
"Shiny workshop",
br(),
strong("bold text")
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
???

- Pause 1 minute
---

# UI 

---
# UI with Layouts

- Typically all items stack up after the other.
--
- Layouts: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html
--
- advanced layouts: fluidRow and column to build your layout up from a grid system or navbarpage
--
- We’ll use sidebarLayout() as done in the example

---
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),

  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
???

- fluidpage creates a page that dynamically adapts to the size of your window

- look at basics_ui.R to the right

-

---

# You can also use tags within *Panel command: UI with Layout and HTML

### Open and run tags_html_06.R

---

# UI: Widgets

- shiny also has built in widgets
